# SMS API Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have analyzed your SMS (Store Management System) application and created comprehensive API documentation based on the existing database structure and frontend service calls. The system is designed for gold/jewelry pawn shop operations.

## What Was Created

### 1. Complete API Documentation (`API_DOCUMENTATION.md`)
- **Authentication**: Login and user registration endpoints
- **Customer Management**: Full CRUD operations with NIC photo upload
- **Item Management**: Jewelry/gold item tracking and management
- **Transaction Management**: Pawn transactions and financial operations
- **Invoice Management**: Invoice generation and tracking
- **User Management**: System user administration
- **Karatage Management**: Gold karat value configuration
- **Loan Period Management**: Loan duration settings
- **Pricing Management**: Dynamic pricing based on karat and loan period
- **Reports**: Customer reports and business overview

### 2. Updated Configuration (`appConfig.json`)
- Added comprehensive `api_endpoints` section
- Organized endpoints by functional modules
- Maintained existing `api_host` and `invoice_settings`
- Provided parameterized endpoint templates (e.g., `{customerId}`, `{nic}`)

## Key Features Identified

### Business Logic
1. **Customer-Centric**: Customers identified by NIC with photo storage
2. **Item Tracking**: Detailed jewelry specifications (weight, karat, value)
3. **Transaction Processing**: Support for both pawn and installment transactions
4. **Dynamic Pricing**: Price calculation based on gold karat and loan period
5. **Loan Management**: Installment tracking and settlement status
6. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Customer activity and business analytics

### Technical Architecture
- **ASP.NET Core** backend with Entity Framework
- **JWT Authentication** with role-based access
- **SQL Server** database with comprehensive audit trails
- **Angular** frontend with modular component structure
- **File Upload** support for NIC photos
- **Multi-part form data** for customer operations

## Database Entities Covered

### Core Business Tables
- `Customers` - Customer information and NIC photos
- `Items` - Jewelry/gold items with specifications
- `Transactions` - Financial transactions
- `TransactionItems` - Junction table for transaction-item relationships
- `Invoices` - Generated invoices with types
- `Loans` - Loan tracking with periods and settlement status
- `Installments` - Payment installment tracking

### Configuration Tables
- `Karats` - Available gold karat values
- `LoanPeriods` - Available loan duration options
- `Pricings` - Price matrix based on karat and loan period
- `InvoiceTypes` - Different invoice categories

### Security Tables
- `AspNetUsers` - User accounts
- `AspNetRoles` - User roles
- `AspNetUserRoles` - User-role relationships

## Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
1. User logs in with username/password
2. Server returns JWT token
3. All subsequent requests include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
4. Admin users can register new users

### File Upload Handling
- Customer NIC photos uploaded as `multipart/form-data`
- Optional photo updates supported
- File storage path tracked in database

### Date Range Queries
- Most GET endpoints support date filtering via `From` and `To` query parameters
- Dates should be in ISO format (e.g., `2024-01-01T00:00:00.000Z`)

### Bulk Operations
- Multiple delete operations supported for customers, items, transactions, invoices, and users
- Batch pricing creation for efficient setup

### Error Handling
- Consistent error response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Authentication checks on all protected endpoints

## Next Steps for Backend Implementation

1. **Implement missing endpoints** identified in the documentation
2. **Add proper validation** for all input models
3. **Implement file upload handling** for NIC photos
4. **Add comprehensive error handling** and logging
5. **Implement proper authorization** based on user roles
6. **Add input validation** and business rule enforcement
7. **Optimize queries** for large datasets
8. **Add audit logging** for sensitive operations

## Configuration Usage

The updated `appConfig.json` now contains all endpoint definitions. Frontend services can reference these like:

```typescript
// Example usage in Angular service
const endpoint = this.config.api_endpoints.customers.getById.replace('{customerId}', customerId);
const url = `${this.config.api_host}${endpoint}`;
```

This approach removes hardcoded URLs and centralizes endpoint management, making the application more maintainable and configurable across different environments.
