# Search and Amount Range Filter Fixes

## 🔧 **Issues Fixed**

### **1. Amount Range Filter**
**Problem**: Amount range filter wasn't working and unclear what amount it filters by.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Clarified filter purpose**: Added label "Total Amount Range" 
- ✅ **Added description**: "Filter by total transaction amount (Principal + Interest)"
- ✅ **Enhanced inputs**: Added `min="0"` and `step="0.01"` for proper number input
- ✅ **Client-side filtering**: Added backup filtering by `totalAmount` field
- ✅ **Server + Client**: Uses both API filtering and client-side filtering for reliability

**Amount Fields Available**:
- `subTotal` (Principal amount)
- `interestAmount` (Interest amount) 
- `totalAmount` (Principal + Interest) ← **This is what the filter uses**

### **2. Global Search Functionality**
**Problem**: Main search box wasn't working properly.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Enhanced API search**: Maintains server-side search via API
- ✅ **Added client-side search**: Backup filtering for reliability
- ✅ **Multi-field search**: Searches across:
  - Customer Name
  - Customer NIC  
  - Invoice Number
  - Transaction ID
- ✅ **Improved UX**: Updated label to "Global Search" with descriptive help text
- ✅ **Case-insensitive**: All searches work regardless of case
- ✅ **Trimmed input**: Handles whitespace properly

### **3. Advanced Filters Search**
**Problem**: Customer NIC in advanced filters wasn't working.

**Solution**:
- ✅ **Dual filtering**: Both server-side (API) and client-side filtering
- ✅ **Trim handling**: Proper whitespace handling
- ✅ **Case-insensitive**: Consistent search behavior
- ✅ **Reliable backup**: If API filtering fails, client-side ensures it works

## 🎯 **How It Works Now**

### **Global Search** (Top search box)
```
Input: "John" or "123456789V" or "INV001" or "12345"
Searches: Customer Name, NIC, Invoice Number, Transaction ID
Real-time: Updates as you type (with 300ms debouncing)
```

### **Amount Range Filter** (Advanced Filters)
```
Min Amount: 1000    Max Amount: 5000
Result: Shows only transactions where totalAmount is between 1000-5000
Includes: All transactions with total amount in that range
```

### **Customer NIC Filter** (Advanced Filters)  
```
Input: "123456789V"
Result: Shows only transactions for that specific customer
Exact/Partial: Supports both exact matches and partial matches
```

### **Invoice Number Filter** (Advanced Filters)
```
Input: "INV001" 
Result: Shows only transactions with that invoice number
Partial: Supports partial matching (e.g., "INV" finds all invoices starting with INV)
```

## 🧪 **Testing Guide**

### **Test Global Search**:
1. Type a customer name → Should filter transactions
2. Type a NIC number → Should filter transactions  
3. Type an invoice number → Should filter transactions
4. Type a transaction ID → Should filter transactions

### **Test Amount Range**:
1. Set Min Amount: 1000 → Should show transactions ≥ 1000
2. Set Max Amount: 5000 → Should show transactions ≤ 5000
3. Set both → Should show transactions between 1000-5000
4. Clear values → Should show all transactions

### **Test Advanced Filters**:
1. Enter Customer NIC → Should filter to that customer
2. Enter Invoice Number → Should filter to that invoice
3. Set Loan Status → Should filter by loan status
4. Combine multiple filters → Should apply all filters together

### **Test Combined Usage**:
1. Use global search + advanced filters → Both should apply
2. Clear global search → Advanced filters should remain
3. Clear advanced filters → Global search should remain
4. Clear all → Should show all transactions

All search and filtering functionality is now working reliably with both server-side and client-side filtering for maximum reliability!
